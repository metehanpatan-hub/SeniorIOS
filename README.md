NGHBRHOOD : LOCATION-BASED NEIGHBOR INTERACTING PLATFORM

NGHBRHOOD is a professional social networking platform that is designed to help people interact within the same apartment. 
Moreover, it is designed in such a way that will allow people living in the same neighborhood see and share the news about that specific neighborhood. 
The application also offers the list of the nearest shops and “chat with the shop” option accordingly. This option allows apartment 
indwellers to place an order with a minimum delivery purchase amount within a minimum delivery time. Despite the social networking design, 
the application will allow users to view and add their bills, so they can keep track of them. The application will send a notification when the bills 
should be paid. The main advantage of the NGHBRHood is that all functions, features that is needed to support a high quality home life, are in the same 
application.
